# APIs for Property Development
In essence, WE-AI is the Siri for multiplayer communication on a Property Development platform.
WE-AI is a virtual assistant that uses project data to interpret and respond to user requests. It's specifically designed to facilitate communication among users in the property development industry. Think of it as Siri, but with a focus on distributing relevant information to architects, contractors, and investors at the right time, ensuring effective communication and coordination.<br>

### The new context created by Generative AI
Large Language Models are a phenomenal technology that will reshape the property development industry, from the investment decision stage down to daily construction site operations<br>

We are creating a comprehensive toolkit to glue together legacy technologies with Generative AI and address inherent challenges of the property development industry<br>
We see a potential for Generative AI to address challenges at the following levels:<br>

:small_blue_diamond: Decision Making and Pre-Investment Phase: `Climate Change Solutions` `ESG compliance`<br>
:small_blue_diamond: Design and pre-construction stage:  

:small_blue_diamond: Construction and project management: `Friction` `Lack of Data` `Uneven Information Distribution` `Safety` `Low Productivity` <br>
The **property development industry** is marked by **inherent challenges**, such as **friction** between parties due to **uneven information distribution, safety concerns**, issues related to **quality**, and **low productivity.**<br>
By connecting the myriad of stakeholders involved in property development processes via streamlined information sharing, we can mitigate these fragmented procedures. <br>

<br><br><br>

## 4. Run powerful applications over your data <br>
Get Services you can not find anywhere else:<br>
**AI-Powered Collaboration Platform:** Enhances stakeholder communication, reducing friction and improving project transparency.<br>
<br>
**Data Aggregation and Visualization:** Captures, aggregates, and presents project data comprehensively.<br>

**Intelligent Information Distribution System:** Distributes relevant information to stakeholders at the right time.<br>

**AI-Driven Safety Monitoring and Alert System:** Monitors site safety continuously, providing real-time alerts.<br>

**Predictive Productivity Analytics:** Analyzes historical data to identify and eliminate productivity bottlenecks.
<br><br>


## 5. Access Domain-Specific, Privately-Owned AI Models Tailored for the Property Development Industry <br>
The transition to deploying fine-tuned, domain-specific, privately-owned AI models tailored for your organization is important and necessary for several reasons:<br>

**Customization:** These models are specifically designed to address your organization's unique needs, challenges, and goals. They can therefore provide solutions that are much more relevant and effective compared to generic, one-size-fits-all AI models.
<br>
**Data Security:** Privately-owned AI models allow you to maintain complete control over your data, which is essential for complying with data privacy regulations and protecting sensitive information.
<br>
**Scalability:** As your organization grows, so too can your AI models. They can be designed to scale with your needs, ensuring you always have the right level of AI power at your disposal.

In this diagram:
1. **AI language technologies:** 
We focus primarily on Large Language Models, showcasing the various options accessible via the we-ai API middleware. 
Our offering extends to **enterprise solutions** that include privately operated **open source models**, empowering businesses with a high degree of customization and control over their AI language technologies, and **private data**.

1. The "LLM Toolkit" represents any language model toolkit, which interacts with the "we-ai API middleware "

2. The **WE-API API Middleware** acts as a middleman, enabling interaction between the "LLM Toolkit" and various data sources (i.e., "Document Store," "Data Getters," and "Data Loaders").

3. Loading Data from **we-ai** into the API Retrieval System
The **WE-API API Middleware** defines an /upsert endpoint for users to load data. This offers a natural integration point with Data Getters hub, which offers over 25 data loaders from various APIâ€™s and document formats, with more under development.

4. The data sources **Document Store, Data Getters, Data Loaders**, represent various document storage and retrieval systems that implement the **WE-API API Middleware** , allowing them to exchange data with the model.

5. The **Meta Index- Question Engines** has been added under **Document Store**, **Data Getters** and **Data Loaders** These represent the vector indices built over any data stored in their respective document stores.

This high-level architecture allows any LLM to access data from various sources seamlessly, provided these sources implement the API. The we-ai API essentially standardizes how these systems interact, making it easier for developers to integrate and manipulate a wide range of data.
