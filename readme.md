# AI Data Framework for the AEC Industry
>Transform scattered processes into streamlined, assembly-line-like procedures forming a more factory-like paradigm.<br>
>Create a Central Platform for Data Driven management powered by AI. Connect all relevant parties to the Hub

<br><br>
### Why we build this framework<br>
We address these challenges:`Friction` `Lack of Data` `Uneven Information Distribution` `Safety` `Low Productivity`<br><br>
The **property development industry** is marked by **inherent challenges**, such as **friction** between parties due to **uneven information distribution, safety concerns**, issues related to **quality**, and **low productivity.**<br><br> 
By connecting the myriad of stakeholders involved in property development processes via streamlined information sharing, we can mitigate these fragmented procedures. <br><br>
The expected outcome is a transformation of disjointed steps into a seamless, assembly-line-like operation, effectively morphing the process into a more factory-like paradigm.<br><br>


# Key components of the framework


## 1. Connect Your Data Sources to Our AI Engine
Integrate Your Data Sources with Our AI Engine: **Unlock** the potential of **untouched data reservoirs**. Transform every piece of information into a valuable data source. Accumulate, order, and systematize data to construct an all-encompassing knowledge base.<br><br>

<br><br>
## 2. Create AI Data Warehouse from Raw, Structured, or Unstructured data 
Harness the power of our AI framework to establish a unified source of information. <br>

<br><br><br>

## 4. Build powerful applications over your data <br>
Build Services you can not get anywhere else:<br>
**AI-Powered Collaboration Platform:** Enhances stakeholder communication, reducing friction and improving project transparency.<br>
<br>
**Data Aggregation and Visualization:** Captures, aggregates, and presents project data comprehensively.<br>

**Intelligent Information Distribution System:** Distributes relevant information to stakeholders at the right time.<br>

**AI-Driven Safety Monitoring and Alert System:** Monitors site safety continuously, providing real-time alerts.<br>

**Predictive Productivity Analytics:** Analyzes historical data to identify and eliminate productivity bottlenecks.
<br><br>


## 5. Deploy Domain-Specific, Privately-Owned AI Models Tailored for Your Organization<br>
The transition to deploying fine-tuned, domain-specific, privately-owned AI models tailored for your organization is important and necessary for several reasons:<br>

**Customization:** These models are specifically designed to address your organization's unique needs, challenges, and goals. They can therefore provide solutions that are much more relevant and effective compared to generic, one-size-fits-all AI models.
<br>
**Data Security:** Privately-owned AI models allow you to maintain complete control over your data, which is essential for complying with data privacy regulations and protecting sensitive information.
<br>
**Scalability:** As your organization grows, so too can your AI models. They can be designed to scale with your needs, ensuring you always have the right level of AI power at your disposal.




<br><br><br>

## 6. Future-Forward Property Development: Data-Driven Platform Business
**The AI Project Hub. What it is and why it matters**
Upon complete deployment, this AI hub empowers you to incorporate various services from multiple stakeholders, capture their operational data, and subsequently offer services that elucidate ways to enhance efficiency, consolidate resources among various parties, or improve the asset's performance.
<br><br><br>

In this diagram:
1. **AI language technologies:** 
We focus primarily on Large Language Models, showcasing the various options accessible via the we-ai API middleware. 
Our offering extends to **enterprise solutions** that include privately operated **open source models**, empowering businesses with a high degree of customization and control over their AI language technologies, and **private data**.

1. The "LLM Toolkit" represents any language model toolkit, which interacts with the "we-ai API middleware "

2. The **WE-API API Middleware** acts as a middleman, enabling interaction between the "LLM Toolkit" and various data sources (i.e., "Document Store," "Data Getters," and "Data Loaders").

3. Loading Data from **we-ai** into the API Retrieval System
The **WE-API API Middleware** defines an /upsert endpoint for users to load data. This offers a natural integration point with Data Getters hub, which offers over 25 data loaders from various APIâ€™s and document formats, with more under development.

4. The data sources **Document Store, Data Getters, Data Loaders**, represent various document storage and retrieval systems that implement the **WE-API API Middleware** , allowing them to exchange data with the model.

5. The **Meta Index- Question Engines** has been added under **Document Store**, **Data Getters** and **Data Loaders** These represent the vector indices built over any data stored in their respective document stores.

This high-level architecture allows any LLM to access data from various sources seamlessly, provided these sources implement the API. The we-ai API essentially standardizes how these systems interact, making it easier for developers to integrate and manipulate a wide range of data.
