# About LCAbyg
https://www.lcabyg.dk/en/<br>
LCAbyg is a tool that calculates life cycle assessments for buildings. With LCAbyg, you can calculate a building's environmental profile and resource consumption. You enter information about the building parts and possibly the building's energy consumption. The program automatically computes the results in a table and generates figures and a summary report.The calculations of environmental impacts are performed over the entire life cycle of the building, including the procurement of raw materials, production of building materials, energy and resource consumption during operation and maintenance, and disposal and possible recycling of building parts and building materials.
