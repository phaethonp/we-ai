Integrated BIM Data Processing and AI-driven Natural Language Response System<br>

- **BIM to JSON**: A BIM drawing is converted into a JSON file using IfcOpenShell.<br>
- **Storage**: The JSON file is stored in a database.<br>
- **Computation**: Upon a user query, calculations are performed on the data.<br>
- **AI Interaction**: The results are submitted to an AI model.<br>
- **Output**: The AI model returns results in natural language to the user.<br>



### The second approach is Zero-Shot Learning.<BR>

2. Zero-Shot Learning

   

The paper discusses the concept of zero-shot information extraction (IE) which seems good enough for our purpose. it does not provide implementation details.<br>
