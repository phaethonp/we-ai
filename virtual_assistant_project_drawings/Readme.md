# Integrated BIM Data Processing and AI-driven Natural Language Response System. 
### Computation approach
- **Storage**: The JSON file is stored in a database.<br>
- **Computation**: Upon a user query, calculations are performed on the data.<br>
- **AI Interaction**: The results are submitted to an AI model.<br>
- **Output**: The AI model returns results in natural language to the user.<br>

- **Output**: The AI model returns results in natural language to the user.<be>

### Dynamic, prompt-based approach.

Summary<br>
The method used to improve the reliability of large language models in Building Information Modeling (BIM) information retrieval is a dynamic, prompt-based approach. This method uses a library of five types of prompts: Intent, Parameter, Value, Summary, and General Question, which are designed to handle tasks such as Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Natural Language Generation (NLG), and Question Answering (QA). The prompts are dynamically adapted based on the use case and user's query, enabling the model to handle a wide variety of natural language queries effectively. This approach allows for continuous improvement by refining the prompts in the library, making it possible for even non-programmers to participate in enhancing the system's NLP capabilities. The method has demonstrated high accuracy rates in classifying texts and interpreting user queries.<br>
