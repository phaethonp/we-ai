# Dynamic User-Centric Guided Content Generation
Inventing new forms of Investigative Journalism <br>

>  We create a radical shift from traditional content writing to curated-guided user-centric content generation. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the process:<br>

:small_blue_diamond:The journalist creates an "Article" within our database that stores all the supporting materials for the news story<br><br>
:small_blue_diamond: The journalist designs a prompt that effectively guides the AI model's response to user-submitted queries.<br><br>
:small_blue_diamond:The user submits a question and receives a response from the system that is guided by the Journalist.<br><br>

The article presented to the user is uniquely shaped by the journalist's guidance, but it is not explicitly created by the journalist.
In essence, this method introduces a novel way of producing investigative journalism content and dynamically generating guided content, all guided by the journalist but not manually created by them.<br>
