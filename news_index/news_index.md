# news index
Autonomously operating, self-automated newspaper, converting complex legislative documents into easily understandable news stories. It's a newspaper that's automatically generated by the system.<BR>


### WORKING MECHANISM
News Index is an **autonomously operating** news platform, powered by machine learning and natural language processing, that **automatically fetches and deciphers** legislation and regulations from government sources, converting them into easily comprehensible news articles. Essentially, it is a newspaper that's autonomously composed by the system<br>

:small_blue_diamond: The service interfaces with various legislative sources, in any state, country, or continent, independently gathering and interpreting legislations or regulations.<br><br>
:small_blue_diamond: Subsequently, it generates a headline and a concise summary for user presentation.<br><br>
:small_blue_diamond: Once the article is created, it is served to the user in a user-friendly format. Users can interact with the content, asking questions or seeking additional information.<br><br>




### SYSTEM COMPONENTS

:small_blue_diamond: News Stories<BR>
The service processes legislations or regulations and then crafts a headline along with a brief summary, presenting it to the user. Essentially, this is a self-automated newspaper generated by machine learning and natural language processing algorithms, converting complex legislative documents into easily digestible news articles. It's a newspaper that's automatically generated by the system.<br>

An example of such a source: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/resources/library/media/20230516RES90302/20230516RES90302.pdf



:small_blue_diamond:Information Retrieval System. <BR>
The servcie provides an efficient information retrieval system through a Question Answering interface using Natural Language.


:small_blue_diamond:Business Agent to proactively identify and serve relevant information to the user and business entity<br>
The system provides a Business Assistant Agent for proactively identifying and serving relevant content to the user.


:small_blue_diamond: Augmented Investigative Journalist:<BR>
we offer journalists an environment and interface where they can write news articles on provided legislation, support them with additional data, and create contrasting or comparative content. All references are provided by the journalists and saved as a "document collection" in our database.<br>

Users can then delve into these articles and additional materials, sparking discussions. This interactive system enhances user engagement with the articles and their linked resources, encouraging a rich and interactive conversation.<br>



# Inventing new forms of Investigative Journalism and Dynamic Guided User-Centric Content Generation

>  We create a radical shift from traditional content writing to curated-guided user-centric content generation. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the process:<br>

:small_blue_diamond:The journalist creates an "Article" within our database that stores all the supporting materials for the news story<br><br>
:small_blue_diamond: The journalist designs a prompt that effectively guides the AI model's response to user-submitted queries.<br><br>
:small_blue_diamond:The user submits a question and receives a response from the system that is guided by the Journalist.<br><br>

The article presented to the user is uniquely shaped by the journalist's guidance, but it is not explicitly created by the journalist.
In essence, this method introduces a novel way of producing investigative journalism content and dynamically generating guided content, all guided by the journalist but not manually created by them.<br>
