### SYSTEM COMPONENTS

:small_blue_diamond: News Stories<BR>
The service processes legislations or regulations and then crafts a headline along with a brief summary, presenting it to the user. Essentially, this is a self-automated newspaper generated by machine learning and natural language processing algorithms, converting complex legislative documents into easily digestible news articles. It's a newspaper that's automatically generated by the system.<br>

:small_blue_diamond: Information Retrieval System. <BR>
The service provides an efficient information retrieval system through a Question Answering interface using Natural Language.


:small_blue_diamond:
The system provides a personal Assistant Agent for proactively identifying and serving relevant content to the user.


:small_blue_diamond: Augmented Investigative Journalist:<BR>
we offer journalists an environment and interface where they can write news articles on provided legislation, support them with additional data, and create contrasting or comparative content. All references are provided by the journalists and saved as a "document collection" in our database.<br>

Users can then delve into these articles and additional materials, sparking discussions. This interactive system enhances user engagement with the Journalist, its work articles, and their linked resources, encouraging a rich and interactive conversation.<br>

# Providing Automated Business Intelligence: The Business Assistant
The system, the "newspaper", will be capable of equipping businesses or individuals with insights into potential risks and opportunities linked to legislation that directly relates to their business or interests.<br> These insights are essential in formulating a robust risk management strategy or devising a business plan.

:small_blue_diamond: Risk Management Services<br>
The system generates concise reports, specific to the business-user, evaluating legislative changes, assessing risk severity, business impact likelihood, and suggesting mitigation strategies<be><br>

:small_blue_diamond: Business Opportunity Services<br>
The system could generate reports analyzing potential opportunities in different markets based on legislative changes. <br>



# Dynamic User-Centric Guided Content Generation
Inventing new forms of Investigative Journalism <br>

>  We create a radical shift from traditional content writing to curated-guided user-centric content generation. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the process:<br>

:small_blue_diamond:The journalist creates an "Article" within our database that stores all the supporting materials for the news story<br><br>
:small_blue_diamond: The journalist designs a prompt that effectively guides the AI model's response to user-submitted queries.<br><br>
:small_blue_diamond:The user submits a question and receives a response from the system that is guided by the Journalist.<br><br>

The article presented to the user is uniquely shaped by the journalist's guidance, but it is not explicitly created by the journalist.
In essence, this method introduces a novel way of producing investigative journalism content and dynamically generating guided content, all guided by the journalist but not manually created by them.<br>
